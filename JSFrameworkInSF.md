Salesforce has is a page dedicated to using SLDS with react: https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/. But the case for using ext. JS frameworks in LWC will be left to you.

Now JS frameworks already have develop out a complex system, which may not support salesforce very well 

Although there may be tens of use cases for using JS frameworks, enterprises may not exactly be jumping with joy when faced with the question of adding another tech stack.

LWC is a client-side "framework" that plays along really well within Salesforce to provide the rich UX for "today's users". 
The additional stack may complement existing LWC with incremental functions, but we don't often find multiple frameworks used together. 
And, it is most likely that the enterprisey functions among them will likely be in LWC at some point in future (exception of edge cases) - thereby sinking the investment dollars.

All of this is the current state. In the future, things may change just like Aura to LWC and Salesforce may jump to Vue, or go directly to WASM.

Refer to some interesting discussions at Lightning Framework vs Standard Client Side Frameworks (i.e. React) // Which to chose when, and why?
Obligatory reference to docs - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/js_libs_platform.htm

2 framework work closely, hard at least.
